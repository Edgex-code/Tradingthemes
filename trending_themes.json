    "content": "Despite aggressive stimulus measures, Chinese consumer spending remains subdued. Household savings are still elevated, and confidence is shaky, particularly among the middle class. While policy support may buoy industrial activity and infrastructure, it’s not translating into robust retail demand. This challenges the bull case for global consumer brands betting on a China rebound in H2 2025. Investors should watch credit growth and job market signals for real consumer traction. Until then, China's recovery remains a tale of two speeds—stronger state-led investment, weaker private consumption."

    "title": "Luxury Market Splits: Ultra-High-End Wins, Mid-Tier Stalls",
    "content": "The luxury sector is diverging. Ultra-luxury brands like Hermès and Rolex are powering ahead, buoyed by resilient demand from the ultra-wealthy. Meanwhile, aspirational and mid-tier names face softness as their core customers pull back. This bifurcation signals a more selective consumer, where brand equity and exclusivity matter more than ever. Investors should recalibrate exposure: premiumization alone isn't a moat. The winners are those commanding cultural cachet and pricing power, not just scale."
